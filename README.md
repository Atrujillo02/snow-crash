# 🏴‍☠️ Snow Crash - 42

This repository documents the resolution of the Snow Crash project from 42 school, completed in collaboration with my friend Alejandro Ruzafa. This project is a cybersecurity challenge designed to develop skills in vulnerability analysis, exploitation, and software security.

## 🎯 Objective

The project consists of a series of levels, each containing a specific vulnerability that must be identified and exploited to gain access to the next level. Throughout the process, we apply static and dynamic analysis techniques, programming in different languages, and offensive security strategies.

## 📌 Approach

For each level, we document:

- The identified vulnerability
- The approach and techniques used to exploit it
- Lessons learned and best security practices

This repository reflects our learning in cybersecurity and serves as a reference for developing skills in forensic analysis, pentesting, and CTFs.
